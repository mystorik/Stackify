# Stackify
Your solution to using a VM without the need of any ISO files or additional programs.

# Requirements
Windows 10 or 11 (or Windows Insider build 18342) - if you have Windows 10 the sandbox will use Windows 10 OS, same goes for W11.

# Why
### This was made for making fast virtual machine on Windows without the hassle of setting one up and downloading .iso files.

# How
### Made using Windows Sandbox, settings get stored inside of a .wsb (Windows Sandbox Config File) and get launched & saved, however once you quit a sandbox, all data is deleted.
